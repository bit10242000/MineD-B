# CI pipeline

### Project goals
1. To develop integration with version control system.
2. To develop automated testing.
3. To develop code quality checks.
4. To develop build automation.

### Stakeholders
1. :scrum master
2. : developer

### Features list 
1. Integration with version control system.

   When changes are pushed to the repository, the CI pipeline is triggered.
2. Automated testing.

   Every time code is committed to the repository, it triggers automated tests to ensure the code works as expected. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and more.
3. Code quality checks.

   Integrate into the CI pipeline to enforce coding standards and detect potential bugs, tools like SonarQube or ESLint.
4. Automated builds.

   The code is automatically built into executable files or packages, ready for deployment.
