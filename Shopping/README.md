Create a shopping system that  handles products, customers, shopping carts, inventory management, payment processing, and order management. Below is a high level outline:

### 1. **System Architecture**

   - **Frontend:** The user interface where customers add minerals to their carts, and proceed to checkout. This is a web application built using frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js.
   - **Backend:** Handles business logic, manages data, and serves the frontend. Typically built with a framework like Node.js (Express).
   - **Database:** Stores data related to users, orders, etc. Options include relational databases like MySQL/PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
   - **Payment Gateway:** Integrate with a payment processor like Stripe, PayPal, or Square to handle transactions.
   - **Inventory Management:** Ensures that stock levels are maintained and synchronized with the availability in shopping carts.
   - **Authentication:** Manages user registration, login, and authorization. Can be implemented using OAuth, JWT, or similar technologies.

### 2. **Database Design**

   - **Entities and Relationships:**
     - **Mineral:** `id`, `name`, `purity and quality description`, `price`, `stock_quantity`,  `image_url`
     - **User:** `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `address`
     - **Shopping Cart:** `id`, `user_id`, `created_at`
     - **CartItem:** `id`, `cart_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`
     - **Order:** `id`, `user_id`, `total_price`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
     - **OrderItem:** `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`
   
   - **Schema Example:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Mineral (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255),
         description TEXT,
         price DECIMAL(10, 2),
         stock_quantity INT,
         image_url TEXT
     );

     CREATE TABLE User (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
         email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
         password_hash TEXT,
         address TEXT
     );

     CREATE TABLE ShoppingCart (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id INT REFERENCES User(id),
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE CartItem (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         cart_id INT REFERENCES ShoppingCart(id),
         product_id INT REFERENCES Product(id),
         quantity INT
     );

     CREATE TABLE Order (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id INT REFERENCES User(id),
         total_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
         status VARCHAR(50),
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE OrderItem (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         order_id INT REFERENCES Order(id),
         product_id INT REFERENCES Product(id),
         quantity INT,
         price DECIMAL(10, 2)
     );
     ```

### 3. **Core Features**

   - **Product Catalog:**
     - Display products with filtering and sorting options (e.g., by price, category, popularity).
     - Include detailed product pages with images, descriptions, and reviews.
   
   - **Shopping Cart:**
     - Allow customers to add, update, or remove items from their cart.
     - Display the cart's contents, subtotal, and total price.
     - Sync cart contents with the server for logged-in users and use local storage for guest users.
   
   - **Inventory Management:**
     - Decrement stock quantity when a product is added to a cart.
     - Periodically check cart contents to ensure stock levels are synchronized.
     - Handle scenarios where stock runs out while items are in carts (e.g., notify users or automatically adjust quantities).

   - **Checkout Process:**
     - Collect shipping information, payment details, and apply any discounts or promotions.
     - Calculate shipping costs and taxes based on the user's location.
     - Integrate with a payment gateway to process payments securely.
   
   - **Order Management:**
     - Store order details and update the order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).
     - Send confirmation emails and allow users to track their orders.
   
   - **Authentication and User Profiles:**
     - Implement user registration, login, and password recovery.
     - Store user preferences, order history, and saved payment methods in their profile.

### 4. **Additional Features**
   - **Product Reviews:** Allow users to leave reviews and rate products.
   - **Wishlist:** Provide an option for users to save products for future purchase.
   - **Admin Dashboard:** Create a backend interface for managing products, orders, users, and inventory.
   - **Promotions and Discounts:** Implement coupon codes, flash sales, and bulk purchase discounts.
   - **Notifications:** Use email or push notifications to inform users about order status, promotions, or restocked items.

### 5. **Technology Stack Options**

   - **Frontend:** Angular, React, Vue.js
   - **Backend:** Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Java with Spring Boot
   - **Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
   - **Authentication:** OAuth, JWT, Passport.js (Node.js), Django Authentication
   - **Payment Gateway:** Stripe, PayPal, Square

### 6. **Deployment**

   - **Cloud Hosting:** Use platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment to streamline updates.
   - **Security:** Implement HTTPS, secure authentication, and data validation to protect user data.

### 7. **Testing**

   - **Unit Tests:** Write tests for individual components (e.g., product listing, cart management).
   - **Integration Tests:** Ensure different components work together as expected.
   - **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate user interactions from the frontend to the backend.
